              framework has been widely used to study steady-state flux
              solutions in genome-scale metabolic networks. One shortcoming of
              current COBRA methods is the possible violation of the loop law
              in the computed steady-state flux solutions. The loop law is
              analogous to Kirchhoff's second law for electric circuits, and
              states that at steady state there can be no net flux around a
              closed network cycle. Although the consequences of the loop law
              have been known for years, it has been computationally difficult
              to work with. Therefore, the resulting loop-law constraints have
              been overlooked. Here, we present a general mixed integer
              programming approach called loopless COBRA (ll-COBRA), which can
              be used to eliminate all steady-state flux solutions that are
              incompatible with the loop law. We apply this approach to improve
              flux predictions on three common COBRA methods: flux balance
              analysis, flux variability analysis, and Monte Carlo sampling of
              the flux space. Moreover, we demonstrate that the imposition of
              loop-law constraints with ll-COBRA improves the consistency of
              simulation results with experimental data. This method provides
              an additional constraint for many COBRA methods, enabling the

  abstract = "ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Constraint-based modeling is increasingly
              employed for metabolic network analysis. Its underlyingassumption
              is that natural metabolic phenotypes can be predicted by adding
              physicochemical constraints toremove unrealistic metabolic flux
              solutions. The loopless-COBRA approach provides an additional
              constraintthat eliminates thermodynamically infeasible internal
              cycles (or loops) from the space of solutions. Thisallows the
              prediction of flux solutions that are more consistent with
              experimental data. However, it is not clearif this approach
              over-constrains the models by removing non-loop solutions as
              well. RESULTS: Here we apply Gordan's theorem from linear algebra
              to prove for the first time that the constraints added
              inloopless-COBRA do not over-constrain the problem beyond the
              elimination of the loops themselves. CONCLUSIONS: The
              loopless-COBRA constraints can be reliably applied. Furthermore,
              this proof may be adapted to evaluatethe theoretical soundness
              for other methods in constraint-based modeling.",

  abstract = "Standard Gibbs energies of reactions are increasingly being used
              in metabolic modeling for applying thermodynamic constraints on
              reaction rates, metabolite concentrations and kinetic parameters.
              The increasing scope and diversity of metabolic models has led
              scientists to look for genome-scale solutions that can estimate
              the standard Gibbs energy of all the reactions in metabolism.
              Group contribution methods greatly increase coverage, albeit at
              the price of decreased precision. We present here a way to
              combine the estimations of group contribution with the more
              accurate reactant contributions by decomposing each reaction into
              two parts and applying one of the methods on each of them. This
              method gives priority to the reactant contributions over group
              contributions while guaranteeing that all estimations will be
              consistent, i.e. will not violate the first law of
              thermodynamics. We show that there is a significant increase in
              the accuracy of our estimations compared to standard group
              contribution. Specifically, our cross-validation results show an
              80\% reduction in the median absolute residual for reactions that
              can be derived by reactant contributions only. We provide the
              full framework and source code for deriving estimates of standard

              quantitative relationship between metabolite concentrations and
              reaction directionality. Despite great efforts, thermodynamic
              data suffers from limited coverage, scattered accessibility and
              non-standard annotations. We present a framework for unifying
              thermodynamic data from multiple sources and demonstrate two new
              techniques for extrapolating the Gibbs energies of unmeasured
              reactions and conditions. RESULTS: Both methods account for
              changes in cellular conditions (pH, ionic strength, etc.) by
              using linear regression over the
              $\Delta$G\textbackslashtextdegree of pseudoisomers and reactions.
              The Pseudoisomeric Reactant Contribution method systematically
              infers compound formation energies using measured K' and pK(a)
              data. The Pseudoisomeric Group Contribution method extends the
              group contribution method and achieves a high coverage of
              unmeasured reactions. We define a continuous index that predicts
              the reversibility of a reaction under a given physiological
              concentration range. In the characteristic physiological range
              3$\mu$M - 3mM we find that roughly half of the reactions in E.
              coli's metabolism are reversible. These new tools will increase
              the accuracy of thermodynamic-based models, especially in
              non-standard pH and ionic strengths. The reversibility index will
              help modelers decide which reactions are reversible in

              with the capability of generating thermodynamically feasible flux
              and metabolite activity profiles on a genome scale. TMFA involves
              the use of a set of linear thermodynamic constraints in addition
              to the mass balance constraints typically used in MFA. TMFA
              produces flux distributions that do not contain any
              thermodynamically infeasible reactions or pathways, and it
              provides information about the free energy change of reactions
              and the range of metabolite activities in addition to reaction
              fluxes. TMFA is applied to study the thermodynamically feasible
              ranges for the fluxes and the Gibbs free energy change,

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: COnstraint-Based Reconstruction and Analysis
                 (COBRA) methods are widely used for genome-scale modeling of
                 metabolic networks in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Due to
                 the successes with metabolism, there is an increasing effort
                 to apply COBRA methods to reconstruct and analyze integrated
                 models of cellular processes. The COBRA Toolbox for MATLAB is
                 a leading software package for genome-scale analysis of
                 metabolism; however, it was not designed to elegantly capture
                 the complexity inherent in integrated biological networks and
                 lacks an integration framework for the multiomics data used in
                 systems biology. The openCOBRA Project is a community effort
                 to promote constraints-based research through the distribution
                 of freely available software. RESULTS: Here, we describe COBRA
                 for Python (COBRApy), a Python package that provides support
                 for basic COBRA methods. COBRApy is designed in an
                 object-oriented fashion that facilitates the representation of
                 the complex biological processes of metabolism and gene
                 expression. COBRApy does not require MATLAB to function;
                 however, it includes an interface to the COBRA Toolbox for
                 MATLAB to facilitate use of legacy codes. For improved
                 performance, COBRApy includes parallel processing support for
                 computationally intensive processes. CONCLUSION: COBRApy is an
                 object-oriented framework designed to meet the computational
                 challenges associated with the next generation of
                 stoichiometric constraint-based models and high-density omics
                 data sets. AVAILABILITY: http://opencobra.sourceforge.net/",

  title    = "The principle of flux minimization and its application to
              estimate stationary fluxes in metabolic networks",
  author   = "Holzh{\"u}tter, Hermann-Georg",
  abstract = "Cellular functions are ultimately linked to metabolic fluxes
              brought about by thousands of chemical reactions and transport
              processes. The synthesis of the underlying enzymes and membrane
              transporters causes the cell a certain 'effort' of energy and
              external resources. Considering that those cells should have had
              a selection advantage during natural evolution that enabled them
              to fulfil vital functions (such as growth, defence against toxic
              compounds, repair of DNA alterations, etc.) with minimal effort,
              one may postulate the principle of flux minimization, as follows:
              given the available external substrates and given a set of
              functionally important 'target' fluxes required to accomplish a
              specific pattern of cellular functions, the stationary metabolic
              fluxes have to become a minimum. To convert this principle into a
              mathematical method enabling the prediction of stationary
              metabolic fluxes, the total flux in the network is measured by a
              weighted linear combination of all individual fluxes whereby the
              thermodynamic equilibrium constants are used as weighting
              factors, i.e. the more the thermodynamic equilibrium lies on the
              right-hand side of the reaction, the larger the weighting factor
              for the backward reaction. A linear programming technique is
              applied to minimize the total flux at fixed values of the target
              fluxes and under the constraint of flux balance (= steady-state
              conditions) with respect to all metabolites. The theoretical
              concept is applied to two metabolic schemes: the energy and redox
              metabolism of erythrocytes, and the central metabolism of
              Methylobacterium extorquens AM1. The flux rates predicted by the
              flux-minimization method exhibit significant correlations with
              flux rates obtained by either kinetic modelling or direct
              experimental determination. Larger deviations occur for segments
              of the network composed of redundant branches where the
              flux-minimization method always attributes the total flux to the
              thermodynamically most favourable branch. Nevertheless, compared
              with existing methods of structural modelling, the principle of
              flux minimization appears to be a promising theoretical approach
              to assess stationary flux rates in metabolic systems in cases
              where a detailed kinetic model is not yet available.",

              a long-standing interest in understanding this functional network
              operation from an evolutionary perspective. On the basis of
              (13)C-determined fluxes from nine bacteria and multi-objective

              the Pareto-optimal surface of a three-dimensional space defined

  abstract      = {Background: Genome-scale metabolic network models and constraint-based modeling techniques have become important tools for analyzing cellular metabolism. Thermodynamically infeasible cy-cles (TICs) causing unbounded metabolic flux ranges are often encountered. TICs satisfy the mass balance and directionality constraints but violate the second law of thermodynamics. Current prac-tices involve implementing additional constraints to ensure not only optimal but also loopless flux distributions. However, the mixed integer linear programming problems required to solve become computationally intractable for genome-scale metabolic models. Results: We aimed to identify the fewest needed constraints sufficient for optimality under the loop-less requirement. We found that loopless constraints are required only for the reactions that share elementary flux modes representing TICs with reactions that are part of the objective function. We put forth the concept of localized loopless constraints (LLCs) to enforce this minimal required set of loopless constraints. By combining with a novel procedure for minimal null-space calculation, the computational time for loopless flux variability analysis is reduced by a factor of 10-150 compared to the original loopless constraints and by 4-20 times compared to the currently fastest method Fast-SNP with the percent improvement increasing with model size. Importantly, LLCs offer a scalable strategy for loopless flux calculations for multi-compartment/multi-organism models of very large sizes (e.g. >104 reactions) not feasible before.

  abstract        = {Computation of steady-state flux solutions in large metabolic models is routinely performed using flux balance analysis based on a simple LP (Linear Programming) formulation. A minimal requirement for thermodynamic feasibility of the flux solution is the absence of internal loops, which are enforced using 'loopless constraints'. The resulting loopless flux problem is a substantially harder MILP (Mixed Integer Linear Programming) problem, which is computationally expensive for large metabolic models. We developed a pre-processing algorithm that significantly reduces the size of the original loopless problem into an easier and equivalent MILP problem. The pre-processing step employs a fast matrix sparsification algorithm-Fast- sparse null-space pursuit (SNP)-inspired by recent results on SNP. By finding a reduced feasible 'loop-law' matrix subject to known directionalities, Fast-SNP considerably improves the computational efficiency in several metabolic models running different loopless optimization problems. Furthermore, analysis of the topology encoded in the reduced loop matrix enabled identification of key directional constraints for the potential permanent elimination of infeasible loops in the underlying model. Overall, Fast-SNP is an effective and simple algorithm for efficient formulation of loop-law constraints, making loopless flux optimization feasible and numerically tractable at large scale.
